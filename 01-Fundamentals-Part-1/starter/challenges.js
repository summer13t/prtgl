//  Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.


// const heighMark = 1.69;
// const heighJohn = 1.95;
// const weightMark = 78;
// const weightJohn = 92;
// const heighMark = 1.88;
// const heighJohn = 1.76;
// const weightMark = 95;
// const weightJohn = 85;
// const marksBMI = weightMark / heighMark ** 2;
// const johnsBMI = weightJohn / heighJohn ** 2;
// console.log(marksBMI, johnsBMI);

// console.log(marksBMI1, markHigherBMI1, markHigherBMI2);



// Coding Challenge #2
// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
// improve it.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement �

// if (marksBMI > johnsBMI) {
//     console.log(`Mark's BMI(${marksBMI}) is higher than John's(${johnsBMI})!`);
// } else {
//     console.log(`John's BMI(${johnsBMI}) is higher than Mark's(${

// Coding Challenge #3
// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
// score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
// score, as well as multiple else-if blocks �
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
// points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// § Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106})!`);
// // }



// const dolphins1 = 90;
// const dolphins2 = 106;
// const dolphins3 = 101;
// const koalas1 = 109;
// const koalas2 = 90;
// const koalas3 = 100;
// const averageDolphins = (dolphins1 + dolphins2 + dolphins3) / 3;
// const averageKoalas = (koalas1 + koalas2 + koalas3) / 3;
// console.log(averageDolphins, averageKoalas);
// if (averageDolphins > averageKoalas && averageDolphins >= 100) {
//     console.log("Dolphins wins! Congratulations !");
// } else if (averageKoalas > averageDolphins && averageKoalas >= 100) {
//     console.log("Koalas wins! Congratulations ! ");
// } else if (averageKoalas >= 100 && averageDolphins >= 100 && averageKoalas === averageDolphins) {
//     console.log("Draw! There is no winner !");
// } else {
//     console.log('no team wins the trophy ! ');

// }

Coding Challenge #4
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
restaurant.In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
300. If the value is different, the tip is 20 %.
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value.Create a variable called 'tip' for
this.It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can
start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
    (bill + tip).Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
316.25”
Test data:
§ Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430


const bill = Number(prompt('bill ?'))
const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`);
